➡️ List

🔹 Use:
 Definition: An ordered, changeable (mutable) collection.
 Allows duplicates.
 Elements are indexed.

🔹 Example:

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "apple"]
print(fruits)        
print(fruits[1])

➡️ Tuple

🔹 Use:
 Definition: An ordered, unchangeable (immutable) collection.
 Allows duplicates.
 Useful for fixed data that should not change.

🔹 Example:

coordinates = (10, 20, 30, 10)
print(coordinates)     # (10, 20, 30, 10)
print(coordinates[0])

➡️ Set

🔹 Use:
 Definition: An unordered, unindexed collection.
 Does not allow duplicates.
 Mutable (you can add/remove items, but order is not guaranteed).

🔹 Example:

numbers = {1, 2, 3, 3, 4}
print(numbers)     # {1, 2, 3, 4} (duplicates removed)
numbers.add(5)
print(numbers)

➡️ Dictionary (dict)

🔹 Use:
 Definition: A collection of key-value pairs.
 Keys must be unique, but values can repeat.
 Ordered (since Python 3.7+), mutable.

🔹 Example:

student = {
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 21,
    "course": "Python"
}

print(student["name"])   # Alice
student["age"] = 22      # Updating value
print(student)

➡️ f-string

🔹 Use:
 Used in Python (3.6+) to format strings easily by inserting variables or expressions inside { }.

🔹 Example:

name = "Legend"
age = 15
print(f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old.")
# Output: My name is Legend and I am 15 years old.

x, y = 5, 3
print(f"{x} + {y} = {x + y}")
# Output: 5 + 3 = 8

➡️ for loop

🔹 Use:
 Used to repeat a block of code for each item in a sequence (like a list, string, or range of numbers).

🔹 Example:

for i in range(1, 6):
    print(i)


Output:
1
2
3
4
5

➡️ Double for loop (Nested loop)

🔹 Use:
 Used when one loop is inside another. Helpful for tables, patterns, or 2D data.

🔹 Example:

user = int(input("Enter a num between 5 to 10 : "))
for i in range(1, user + 1): 
    for num in range(1, 11):
        print(i, "*", num, "=", i * num)

➡️ while loop

🔹 Use:
 Repeats a block of code as long as a condition is True.
 Good when you don’t know in advance how many times you need to loop.

🔹 Example:

i = 1
while i <= 5:
    print(i)
    i += 1


Output:
1
2
3
4
5

➡️ while True

🔹 Use:
 Creates an infinite loop that runs forever until stopped manually (or with break).
 Useful for menus, repeated inputs, or continuous programs.

🔹 Example:

num = 2
while True:
    guess = int(input("Enter your guess between 1 to 10 : "))
    if guess == num:
        print("Congratulations, your answer is correct!")
        break
    else:
        print("Wrong answer, try again.")

➡️ break

🔹 Use:
 Stops the current loop immediately, even if the condition is still True.
 Works with both for and while loops.

🔹 Example:

num = 2
while True:
    guess = int(input("Enter your guess between 1 to 10 : "))
    if guess == num:
        print("Congratulations, your answer is correct!")
        break
    else:
        print("Wrong answer, try again.")

➡️ String Methods
🔹 1. Uppercase & Lowercase

Use: Convert text to uppercase or lowercase.

word = "apple"
print(word.upper())   # APPLE
print(word.lower())   # apple

🔹 2. Capitalize

Use: Makes the first letter uppercase and the rest lowercase.

word = "hello world"
print(word.capitalize())  # Hello world

🔹 3. Count

Use: Counts how many times a substring appears.

word = "banana"
print(word.count("a"))  # 3

🔹 4. Replace

Use: Replaces part of a string with another.

text = "I like apples"
print(text.replace("apples", "mangoes"))
# Output: I like mangoes

🔹 5. Find

Use: Returns the index of the first occurrence of a substring.

text = "Python is fun"
print(text.find("fun"))   # 10

🔹 6. Split & Join

Use: Split breaks a string into a list, join connects elements back into a string.

sentence = "I love coding"
words = sentence.split()      # ['I', 'love', 'coding']
print(words)

new_sentence = "-".join(words)
print(new_sentence)           # I-love-coding

🔹 7. Strip (remove spaces)

Use: Removes spaces from the beginning and end of a string.

name = "   Rahul   "
print(name.strip())   # Rahul

🐍 1. Introduction to Python

Python is a high-level, interpreted, and general-purpose programming language.
That’s just fancy talk for saying:
👉 It’s easy to read (like English),
👉 It doesn’t need to be compiled before running,
👉 You can use it for almost anything — apps, AI, games, data science, web, automation, and more.

🔹 High-Level Language

You don’t have to worry about things like memory or hardware.
Python handles the behind-the-scenes stuff, so you can focus on logic and ideas.

Example:

print("Hello, Legend!")


Boom — it prints. No setup drama. No semicolons war. 😎

🔹 Interpreted Language

Python runs line by line — like a teacher checking your homework sentence by sentence.

If there’s an error, it stops right there and shows you what went wrong.
That’s what this means:

“Interpreted (no need for compilation) — line by line, error stops the code.”

💡 Compiler languages (like C or Java) check the whole code at once before running.
If there’s an error, they’ll tell you after scanning everything.

🔹 Dynamically Typed

You don’t have to tell Python what kind of data you’re using.
It’s smart enough to figure it out.

Example:

a = 6       # Python knows it's an integer
b = "Legend"  # Python knows it's a string


Other languages (like C or Java) would require:

int a = 6;
string b = "Legend";


Python? It just vibes and auto-detects. 🔍✨

🔹 Multiple Programming Styles Supported

Python lets you code in your own way.
It supports:

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): using classes and objects

Functional Programming: using functions like map(), filter()

Procedural Programming: step-by-step instructions

So whether you’re an artist or an engineer, Python adjusts to your style. 🎨⚙️

🔹 Huge Standard Library

Python comes loaded with ready-made tools — called modules.
These are like plug-and-play power-ups.

Example:

import math
import random
import numpy


You don’t have to write everything from scratch — just import and roll.
That’s why it’s said:

“Huge standard library. Example: import numpy”

🔹 Portable

Python works almost everywhere:

Android

Windows

macOS

Linux

Write the code once — it runs anywhere (no rework needed).
That’s why it’s called portable.

💡 Compare with Other Languages
Platform	Common Languages
Android	Java, Kotlin
Windows	C++, C, Python, Java

Python joins this lineup because it’s flexible — it can blend into almost any environment.

2. Basic Syntax
🔹 Comments

Used to add notes or explanations in your code.
They’re ignored by Python — just for humans to read.

# This is a single-line comment


➡ Symbol: # (called hashtag or hash)
➡ Shortcut: Ctrl + / to toggle comment on/off
➡ Undo shortcut: Ctrl + Z

🔹 Print Statement

Used to display messages or output.

print("Hello, World!")


✅ Python automatically moves to a new line after printing.

🔹 Variables

No need to declare types — Python auto-detects it.

name = "Alice"   # String
age = 20         # Integer


💡 Dynamic typing = Python figures out the type for you (unlike C or Java).

🧮 3. Data Types
Type          Example          Description
int           10               Whole numbers
float	      3.14	           Decimal numbers
str	          "hello"          Text data
bool	      True / False	   Boolean values
list	      [1, 2, 3]	       Ordered, changeable
tuple	      (1, 2, 3)        Ordered, unchangeable
set	          {1, 2, 3}	       Unordered, unique
dict	      {"name":"John",  Key-value pairs
                "age":25}	


🖋️ 4. Input and Output
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print("Hello,", name)


input() always returns a string by default.

⚙️ 5. Operators
🔹 Arithmetic Operators

+ - * / % // **

Examples:

print(7 / 2)   # 3.5  (normal division)
print(7 // 2)  # 3    (floor division, removes decimal)
print(2 ** 3)  # 8    (power operator)


✅ ** = Exponent → multiply number by itself.

🔹 Comparison Operators

== != > < >= <=
Used to compare values — result is always True or False.

🔹 Logical Operators

and, or, not

a = True
b = False
print(not a)   # False


👉 not flips the truth value — used with booleans only.

🔹 Assignment Operators

=, +=, -=, *=, /=

a = 0
a += 6   # same as a = a + 6

🔹 Membership Operators

in, not in

nums = [1, 2, 3]
print(2 in nums)      # True
print(4 not in nums)  # True


Checks if a value exists in a list or not.

🔹 Identity Operators

is, is not
Used to check if two variables refer to the same object.

a = [1,2,3]
b = a
print(a is b)  # True

🧩 6. Conditional Statements

Decision-making in Python:

if condition:
    # code
elif another_condition:
    # code
else:
    # code


Example:

age = 18
if age >= 18:
    print("Adult")
else:
    print("Minor")

🔁 7. Loops
for loop
for i in range(5):
    print(i)

Loop Control
for i in range(1, 6):
    if i == 2:
        continue    # Skips 2
    print(i)


➡ Output: 1, 3, 4, 5
break → stops loop
continue → skips current turn
pass → does nothing (placeholder)

🧮 8. Functions

Reusable blocks of code.

def greet(name):
    return "Hello " + name

print(greet("John"))

Types of Arguments

Positional: order matters

Keyword: use parameter name

Default: has preset value

Variable length: *args, **kwargs

🍎 9. Lists and Tuples

List

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
fruits.append("mango")
print(fruits[1])


Tuple

colors = ("red", "green", "blue")
print(colors[0])


Tuple can’t be changed — it’s fixed.

🗝️ 10. Dictionary and Set
student = {"name": "Tom", "age": 20}
print(student["name"])

student["age"] = 21   # Update value


Set example:

nums = {1, 2, 3, 3}
print(nums)  # {1, 2, 3} (no duplicates)

🧵 11. String Operations
s = "Hello World"
print(s.lower())
print(s.upper())
print(s[0:5])
print(len(s))
print(s.replace("World", "Python"))


Python strings = powerful and flexible 🔥

📁 12. File Handling

Write:

f = open("data.txt", "w")
f.write("Hello Python")
f.close()


Read:

f = open("data.txt", "r")
print(f.read())
f.close()


"w" → write mode, "r" → read mode.

🚨 13. Exception Handling
try:
    num = int(input("Enter number: "))
    print(10 / num)
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero!")
except ValueError:
    print("Invalid input")
finally:
    print("Program ended")


✅ try = test block
✅ except = handle error
✅ finally = always runs

👤 14. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def greet(self):
        print("Hello, my name is", self.name)

p1 = Person("Alice", 25)
p1.greet()

Concepts

Class → blueprint

Object → instance of a class

Constructor → __init__()

Inheritance → reuse from parent class

Polymorphism → same method, different behavior

Encapsulation → data protection

📦 15. Modules and Packages

Example:

import math
print(math.sqrt(16))


Custom Module
mymodule.py

def add(a, b):
    return a + b


Then:

import mymodule
print(mymodule.add(2, 3))
