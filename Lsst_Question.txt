Project Title:
School Report Card Management System

Objective:
Create a Python program using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to manage student details, store marks, calculate results, and display report cards.

Project Requirements:

1( Use of OOP (Mandatory)
The program must use classes and objects.
You must create at least two classes.

Class 1: Student
This class represents one student.

Attributes:
- Student Name
- Roll Number
- Class / Grade
- Marks (for multiple subjects)

Methods:
- Add marks for a subject
- Calculate average marks
- Calculate final grade (A, B, C, D)
- Display student report card
)
Class 2: School
This class manages many students.

Responsibilities:
- Store multiple student objects
- Add a new student
- Search for a student using roll number
- Display report cards of all students

2) Menu-Driven Program
The program should display the following menu:

1. Add New Student
2. Add Marks to Student
3. View Student Report Card
4. View All Students
5. Exit

The user should select options using numbers.

3) Grade Calculation Rules

Average Marks and Grade:
- 90 and above : A
- 75 to 89     : B
- 60 to 74     : C
- Below 60     : D

4) Program Rules
- Use proper class methods
- Use meaningful variable names
- Display output neatly
- Program should not crash for wrong input
- Follow basic Python coding style

Optional – Extra Marks:
- Save student data to a file
- Load data from file when program starts
- Add rank calculation
- Add teacher password before accessing menu
